# Terraform S3 Module

This Terraform module creates an AWS S3 bucket with customizable settings such as bucket name, tags (e.g., project name, environment), and outputs like the bucket ID. It is designed to make managing S3 buckets in AWS easier and more configurable.

# Features

-> S3 Bucket Creation: Easily create and configure AWS S3 buckets.

-> Custom Tags: Add customizable tags (e.g., project, environment) to the S3 bucket for better resource management.

-> Bucket ID Output: The module outputs the S3 bucket's ID for further use in your Terraform configurations or scripts.

-> Simple Integration: Can be easily integrated into any Terraform-based infrastructure deployment.

-> Flexible Tagging: Define multiple tags for your S3 bucket (e.g., project, environment).

# Architecture

This Terraform module utilizes AWS resources to create and manage an S3 bucket. The S3 bucket will be tagged based on user-defined input values, and it outputs the bucket ID after creation.

# Module Components:

1. S3 Bucket: The main AWS resource provisioned by the module.

2. Tags: Custom tags (e.g., project, environment) are applied to the S3 bucket for better identification and management.

3. Bucket ID Output: After provisioning the bucket, the module outputs the unique bucket ID which can be referenced in other resources or Terraform outputs.

# Module Usage

Example: Create an S3 Bucket with Tags and Output Bucket ID

```css
module "s3_bucket" {
  source      = "path_to_this_module"
  bucket_name = "my-example-bucket"
  tags = {
    project     = "my-project"
    environment = "development"
  }
}
```

Example Terraform Configuration (main.tf)

```css
module "s3_bucket" {
  source      = "path_to_this_module"
  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  
  tags = {
    project     = "example-project"
    environment = "production"
  }
}

output "bucket_id" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_id
}
```

# Inputs

The module accepts the following input variables:

bucket_name: The name of the S3 bucket to be created.
Type: string
Required: Yes

tags: A map of tags to assign to the S3 bucket. This can include tags such as project, environment, etc.

Type: map(string)

Default: {} (empty map)

# Outputs

bucket_id: The unique ID of the created S3 bucket.

Type: string

# Example of Using the Module in Your Project

```css
`module "s3_bucket" {
  source      = "path_to_this_module"
  bucket_name = "unique-bucket-name"
  
  tags = {
    project     = "new-project"
    environment = "staging"
  }
}

output "bucket_id" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_id
}`
```
